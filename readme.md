Markdown Build
--------------

**Markdown Build** is a tool for building a tree 
of Markdown files. It takes two parameters:  
Source Directory and
Destination Directory. 
Files are recursively copied from the source to the destination transforming any markdown files to html along the way.

It supports the concept of partials. It auto-includes js and css files.

The goal is for the transformation process to be straightforward and intuitive: like Markdown.
